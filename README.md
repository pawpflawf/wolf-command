# Wolf Command - Serious Taming #
## Latest: 1.0 ##

This plugin allows users to command their wolves better than basic Minecraft. It gives players the ability to tell all their wolves to sit/stand as well as attack monsters at range by swinging a stick at them. When left-click with a stick at a monster within 40 blocks, your wolves will teleport to it and start attacking.
