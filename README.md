# WolfCommand #
###A Bukkit Plugin###

This plugin allows users to command their wolves better. It gives them the ability to tell all their wolves or sit/stand as well as attack monsters at range by swinging a stick at them. When left-click with a stick at a monster within 40 blocks, your wolves will teleport to it and start attacking.
